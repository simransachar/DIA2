These challenges include computation, interaction, visualization and user challenges. Addressing the computation challenge is a central research focus and remains a prominent direction in the field, while the other challenges are often overlooked. The goal of this CAREER project is to address these less investigated challenges by pioneering a comprehensive framework toward effective visual understanding of flow fields. It contributes to the state of the art flow visualization by promoting an innovative database approach to shape-based field line modeling and classification, investigating new string-, sketch- and graph-based interfaces and interactions for flow field exploration, and exploring occlusion and clutter reduction through unconventional streamline repositioning and automatic tour generation. The general approach developed in this research is expected to substantially improve our ability to visually understand a wide spectrum of flow fields, ranging from the traditional application of fluid flows to new applications such as traffic flows, cash flows and message flows. This project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the area of data visualization and scientific computing via capstone class projects. A pedagogical toolbox will be designed along with web-based resources to support teaching visualization classes through expressive demos, potentially benefiting universities nationwide with a similar teaching need. The PI will continue to attract underrepresented students through university and department outreach programs and engage local middle and high school students through summer youth programs. 

This research tackles the fundamental challenges in visualizing large, complex three-dimensional steady and unsteady flow fields. Underlying the proposed work is a novel database approach to field line shape encoding, classification and interrogation. The PI will integrate and unify a variety of concepts from geometric modeling, computer vision and data mining to create robust visual characters and words from field lines for shape analysis and organization. Novel interfaces and interactions will be introduced to enable intuitive retrieval of partial field lines via textual and visual forms, and examination of hierarchical field lines and their spatiotemporal relationships in the transformed graph space. Innovative streamline repositioning for focus+context viewing and automatic tour for examining hidden or occluded flow features will be devised to move from clutter to clarity in the visualization. The success of this research will benefit a wide variety of applications within and beyond graphics and visualization, such as shape analysis, visual perception, database organization, game development, and visualization in education.

The PI will collaborate with scientists and researchers at university, industry and national labs, applying the proposed solutions to solve real-world problems. Research results will be evaluated through both domain expert reviews and formal user studies. Selected research outcomes will be integrated into user-engaging educational applications that will be run on tablet devices and delivered to the general public for wide dissemination. This CAREER project will build a solid foundation for addressing key challenges in flow visualization, and lead to multidisciplinary collaborations spanning atmospheric cloud, combustion chemistry and cardiovascular research. It will also produce fruitful deliverables, featuring the first-ever benchmark field line shape database, tutorials and workshops at premier visualization conferences, and pedagogical tools and game apps."

This ongoing conference (since 1988) is a regional forum for scientific presentation and exchange for 104 participants: graduate students, postdocs, young faculty and undergraduates--many of whom will be presenting at a major technical meeting for the first time. A distinctive feature of MTSM is its focus on graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty. The overwhelming majority of the contributed talks are given by either graduate students or, less often, by postdoctoral fellows. In addition, undergraduate researchers will be invited to attend the meeting and present their research at a dedicated poster session. For most undergraduates, this will be their first opportunity to interact in detail with more senior researchers from other institutions. Recruitment will be facilitated by working with the Minority Affairs Committee (MAC) of AIChE along with announcements submitted to the websites of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) and Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). The student chapters of these organizations among the Big Ten Plus universities will also be contacted with a flyer. Thus, this conference represents a serious effort to recruit interest among underrepresented minorities and also serves a critical need for ?growing? the future community of researchers in one key area of the NSF IPT program.<br/><br/>Thermodynamic and materials properties and the underlying understanding of molecular and meso-scale mechanisms retain and increase their central importance amid rapid changes in nanoengineering, biotechnology, and energy resources. While the technical program will, in significant measure, be shaped by the abstracts contributed by the various research groups attending,the organizers anticipate forming sessions around themes of (1) Phase Equilibria, (2) Molecular Simulations, (3) Thermodynamics of Advanced Materials, and (4) New Developments in Theory. Applications covered by these headings could include multi-scale modeling, interfaces and biological membranes, nanotechnology, and biotechnology and drug delivery."

In 2014, there are four MRC conferences proposed, all to be held in Snowbird, Utah: Cluster Algebras, June 8 - 14, 2014; Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics in Applied Mathematics, June 15 - 21, 2014; Mathematics of Quantum Phases of Matter and Quantum Information, June 25 - July 1, 2014; and Network Science, June 25 - July 1, 2014. The topics of the conferences to be held in 2015 and 2016 will be determined later by the MRC Advisory Board, which evaluates proposals submitted by senior mathematicians who wish to be organizers. Each of the MRC conferences will bring together a diverse group of young mathematicians. The organizing committee for each conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and conferences. The conferences will bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many years after the conference itself. 

The goal of the Mathematics Research Communities program is to create research cohorts of young mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time, fostering joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually, reach all areas of mathematics. The Mathematics Research Communities program strives to achieve this goal through the following activities in addition to the summer research conferences: Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings, mentoring and a discussion network. It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national) professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist. The creation of three to four new cohorts per year has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of research, and will have an extremely positive effect on mathematics research in the U.S. Most importantly, this program will focus on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in, eventually, all research areas of mathematics. This proposal is requesting support for an additional three years of this unique program. Conference topics will include both pure and applied mathematics areas of research.

The event will take place in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2014 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held July 28-August 1 in Melbourne, Australia, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Symposium. Established in 1984, VL/HCC's mission is to support the design, formalization, implementation and evaluation of computing systems that are easier for a broader group of people to learn, use, and understand. This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web. It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal. VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software. Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society. People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code. Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games. Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends. More information about the VL/HCC Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2014. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the twelfth to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand. In particular, what methods, models and tools can people use to visualize, analyze, tailor, and direct socio-technical systems? The doctoral consortium aims to stimulate novel approaches that go far beyond simplistic solutions like Web browsers and search engines. Although search engines do provide information that is useful in simple situations, they represent only one portion of a socio-technical system (information retrieval); search engines alone are not powerful enough to be used to start new businesses and run them competitively, for example, since they only give people the ability to find resources provided by other people rather than the ability to create new resources. Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society. <br/><br/>The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education. It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel. The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented. As in prior years the VL/HCC 2014 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program. A 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society. This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other. The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women; to further increase diversity, no more than 2 student participants (one of whom must be female if two are accepted) will be accepted from any one institution."

In 2010, 29% of the mathematics doctorates were awarded to women, while less than 4% were awarded to minority students. USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more inclusive and collaborative mathematics community. Graduate students who attend USTARS are better equipped to seek academic positions and continue the cycle of mathematical research and collaboration. Undergraduate students are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, often more comprehensive than the topics available at their home institutions. A one-day workshop at the start of USTARS focuses on specific stages in professional careers and the critical transitions associated with each stage. Participants have the opportunity to network with underrepresented professors and students who may become future collaborators, colleagues, and/or mentors. USTARS participants continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.

The approach to overcome this difficulty is to use this grant to partially support the travel costs for the student attendees, plus other contributions from the departments across the country and the Institute of Industrial Engineers, so as to increase students' participation. This grant will help promote student research activities and active involvements in international conferences. By attending this conference, students can present their recent research developments, attend tutorial sessions to learn advanced research methods, join panel discussions, participate in student paper/simulation competitions, and socialize with scholars and students from other universities. These activities will significantly help and motive students to explore research frontiers and consider joining academia as one of their career paths. <br/><br/>If successful, this award will help US and international students to communicate and learn from each other the most frontier research progress.

The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2014 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2014), which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI) and will be held April 26-May 1 in Toronto, Canada. The annual CHI conference is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and is attended by approximately 3,400 HCI professionals from around the world. Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected research publications in the field of HCI. More information about the conference is available online at http://chi2014.acm.org.

The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers. Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference. Student participants will present their work during the two full days of the Consortium on April 26-27. Each student will have a 45-minute time slot in which to make a formal presentation and receive feedback from the faculty panel, which is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. The program for the two full days of the Consortium will also include substantial informal opportunities for discussion and additional feedback, with follow up activities planned during the technical program of the conference. Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2014 Extended Abstracts, which is distributed to all conference registrants and included in the ACM Digital Library. SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the event, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia. The CHI doctoral consortia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading HCI researchers participated as students in earlier consortia.

Broader Impacts: The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development. Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees. In accordance with CISE policy, NSF funds will be used solely to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States, although there will also be a number of international participants in recognition of the fact that the HCI field embraces educational and cultural traditions that vary in different parts of the world. The organizers have undertaken to work to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants; as a consequence, the student and faculty participants will constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, which will help broaden the students' horizons to the future benefit of the field. To further promote diversity no more than one student will be accepted from any given institution, except in the case where including a second student from the same school would allow a woman to be a participant.

The theory found wide applications in physical sciences (such as quantum mechanics) and in other areas of mathematics (notably number theory and geometry). The power of the theory comes, in part, from its utilization of algebra and topology in concert with analysis.

This year, the SBC will be held in conjunction with the 7th World Congress of Biomechanics (WCB) from July 6-11 in Boston, MA. The budget request of $50,200 to the NSF ($28,760 to GARDE, $21,440 to BME and Nano & Biomechanics) has three primary purposes: to help increase student attendance and participation at the conference by reducing student registration fees and providing complimentary student registration to 36 Ph.D. finalists in the Student Paper Competition; to provide a 4th year of support for the successful Undergraduate Design Competition; and to support a special symposium on neural functionality failure analysis and augmented repair. The conference format will be 20 parallel sessions of oral presentations, 3 poster sessions, and 11 plenary sessions. Student focused events will include a Student Paper Competition, with both oral and poster presentations, and 2 design and computation competitions. The finalists for the Ph.D. paper competition, undergraduate design, and computation competition will present their work in parallel oral sessions. All technical presentations will be supported by 400-word abstracts and compiled in a digital format for distribution to all registrants. The primary purpose of the SBC and WCB have been, and continue to be, to promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on biomechanical engineering, encompassing molecular to tissue and organism-level approaches. This conference highlights students, promotes advancement in their education and furthers their careers towards becoming future leaders in bioengineering.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit : The SBC and WCB are extremely high quality and intellectually stimulating interdisciplinary scientific meetings. They are, respectively, the premiere meetings for biomechanical engineering in North America and internationally. In this combined meeting, the BED has insured the inclusion of many of the traditional features of the SBC. Two Challenges, the Undergraduate Design Competition and Grand Challenge in Predicting Knee Loads, will highlight student achievements in engineering design and modeling and will rapidly advance the field through simultaneously encouraging competition and collaboration. The ASME-sponsored Student Paper Competition will highlight the research of the next generation of biomedical engineers. The winners of the BED?s Early, Mid, and Lifetime Career Awards will make scientific presentations.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts : In addition to the direct impact this conference will have on the mainstream bioengineering community, it serves an important cross-fertilization role. In attendance will be bioengineers, engineers from other disciplines, cell and molecular biologists, biochemists, biophysicists, and other scientists. In that manner, this conference will have a much broader impact than if it were to be attended by just the biomechanics community. As importantly, 50% of the attendees are expected to be students and postdoctoral fellows. This will have a broad impact on bioengineering as future leaders are developed through the student paper, design, and computational competitions as well as networking opportunities. Through the digital proceedings and the conference web site, information presented at the meeting will be available to multiple societies and to the public at large."

This project seeks to evaluate how election observers affect citizens' political attitudes and behaviors around these elections. Election observers, which come from both international and domestic organizations, seek to improve public confidence in elections through their presence at elections and their public reports on election quality. Previous research suggests that local citizens' perceptions of elections' credibility may affect their political participation in a myriad of ways, from promoting democratic engagement and voter turnout to increasing the likelihood of protest and election violence. Thus, election observers may have significant effects on democratization and peace through their effects on beliefs about election credibility. Given the political events in the Middle East and North Africa since 2011, the knowledge produced from this proposed study has great relevance for peace and stability in the region. In particular, the knowledge can help to inform policymakers and international non-governmental organizations that are involved in post-conflict re-construction .<br/><br/><br/>This project will embed experiments in a panel survey around Tunisia's legislative and presidential elections, which will occur on October 26, 2014, and November 23, 2014, respectively. The experiments will deliver information about election observers' presence and reports at the October 26th election to randomly selected citizens in a nationally representative survey conducted immediately following that election. Factors that will be varied include the identity of election observers (U.S., European, or domestic) and the content of their reports (positive or negative). The project's outcomes will include citizens' perceptions of the credibility of the October 26th election as well as their election turnout, vote choice, and other political behaviors (e.g., protest) during and after the November 23rd election. The latter outcomes will be measured via a post-election survey with the same panel of respondents immediately following the November 23rd election. Thus, if election observers affect perceptions of election credibility, then this project will also be able to estimate how election observers affect a range of other future political behaviors via beliefs about election credibility for the first time using causal mediation analysis."

PNWNAS has been an annual event since 1987, held on a Saturday each fall in the northwestern states of USA and nearby Canadian provinces. The goal of this meeting is to bring together researchers from universities, government research labs, and industry from the Pacific Northwest region to share expertise in the field of numerical analysis and computational mathematics. This conference will enable computational scientists in the region to hear, consult, and possibly collaborate with the outside speakers and members of other institutions in disciplinary or interdisciplinary research areas. Meanwhile, it will also facilitate interactions that lead to employment and internship opportunities for postdocs, undergraduates, graduate students and members of underrepresented groups attending the conference. <br/><br/>There will be about 70-80 participants for the 2014 seminar, with 8 invited speakers from industry, government, and academia. The talks will be mainly concerned with modeling large-scale complex systems, construction of accurate and efficient numerical schemes, energy sustainability, and software and hardware development, including emerging computer architectures. The last two topics are popular research fields in local government and industry. Poster sessions will be arranged for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to present their research work so as to maximize their visibility to all participants. Meanwhile, the inclusion of participants from national labs and industrial partners will bring new potential internship and employment opportunities for the students and postdocs attending the meeting. The seminar will be publicized through various communication channels, including Portland State University student chapter of the Society of Women Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, and Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Program to broaden participation from members of those underrepresented groups. The exposure to topics and techniques not typically available at the home universities and the opportunity for face-to-face collaboration will enhance the research programs of faculty, student, and postdoc participants. <br/><br/>Seminar web site: http://faculty.washington.edu/rjl/pnwnas/"

These environments include systems of interacting components coming from the natural world, human-created world, and socio-cultural contexts. Because of the complexity of multiple interacting elements of systems in which S&T are embedded, the impacts of S&T are not always predictable or even understood. Furthermore, how to govern science and technology in the best manner possible, upstream of technological deployment, is not usually obvious. Through better understanding these systems and interactions within them, policies for S&T can be better designed and executed. For example, sensitive system components, feedback loops, or leverage points can be identified and targeted for policy-making or future data collection. Yet, systems research is difficult. A holistic understanding of S&T policy systems requires the multi-disciplinary and diverse perspectives of, scholars, practitioners, and stakeholders to examine them from scientific and practical standpoints.<br/><br/>Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) provide an international forum for the presentation and discussion of frontier research in the natural and physical sciences designed to maximize productive interaction between attendees. For over 75 years they, have been viewed as the world's premier scholarly meetings. The 2014 GRC on S&T Policy: Systems Approaches to Research and Practice (August 10-15, 2014) will address the challenges and opportunities associated with systems research and practice in S&T Policy. A Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will precede the 2014 GRC on S&T policy and take place on Aug 9-10, 2014. The GRS creates a forum for graduate students and those starting their careers to present their work and receive mentoring by more experienced professionals in the field. This type of conference is an important component of training, as participants gain valuable leadership experience as speakers, discussion leaders, and organizers. GRS participants also attend the GRC and present posters, allowing them to interact with prominent S&T policy scholars. Both the GRS and GRC, explicitly promote participation by diverse communities, including women, under-represented minorities, scholars from developing countries, and multiple sector-representatives (government, non-profits, industry, academe, think-tanks, et al). The conference will serve to increase the presence of these groups in the field.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>The conference will improve scholarship within S&T policy and help to harness the knowledge to innovate in public-policy domains, matching two key goals of the NSF Science of Science Policy program. The conference will have positive downstream effects on decision-making about S&T, will help to better define the field of S&T policy, and will assist in setting an research agenda for important unanswered questions. The GRS/GRC is expected to increase graduate-student and young-scholar interest in the field of S&T Policy (including the Science of Science Policy), and in many cases, to change the course of their careers."

Robots are being used to carry out assembly, welding, material handling and fabrication. Even as such interactions are becoming more common in every phase of manufacturing, a perfect symbiotic relationship between machines and human beings is still very far away. Because of this, a majority of the robotic applications in manufacturing are currently limited to areas where a relatively low level of skill is required. This has restricted the full potential of robotics to augment human operators and improve productivity and quality of life. With recent advances in cognitive neuroscience and brain interface technologies, connecting the human cognitive thought process directly to robots and machines is possible, resulting in direct control of real world applications. By collecting the brain signals using sensors and analyzing the thought processes, many activities that take place inside the brain when humans take specific actions or think of actions can be identified and matched to known signals using fast computation. This new human-robot communication paradigm will be demonstrated by developing three manufacturing scenarios. The project will also have broad applicability in the design of robotic systems in fields outside manufacturing, including telesurgery, rehabilitation and space exploration. Results from this multidisciplinary research, which combines manufacturing, computer science and robotics, have the potential to improve the productivity of future manufacturing plants and can lead to new commercial ventures, which will help the US maintain global leadership in robotics and manufacturing, broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>Significant future challenges in the development of a new human-robot communication system, which allows operators to perform complex high skilled tasks, will be addressed. The postulated paradigm will be explored by meeting the following intellectual challenges: (i) researching a novel methodology for communicating motion commands to a robot by imagining simple actions using a grammar called ""actemes,"" (ii) new brain-computer mode and algorithms to classify these actemes and, (iii) an intent-based system that auto-completes robotic actions based on most likely sequence of events that human operators are planning to complete. Three robotic manufacturing scenarios will be explored to demonstrate the human cognition based interactions in manufacturing environment: assembly, direct control, and quality control through object recognition. Finally, by using a non-invasive brain-computer interface a wide range of day-to-day applications of robotics will be demonstrated."

Students with various engineering backgrounds therefore have a choice of projects and also opportunities for multidisciplinary teamwork, as applicable. <br/><br/>Students have the opportunity to select one of the following cutting-edge projects: (1)The Nanoaquarium that consists of a thin liquid layer sandwiched between two electron transparent silicon nitride membranes; (2) Colorimetric Photonic Crystal Microsphere Sensors whose goals is the development of an environmentally benign colorimetric sensor that can detect heavy metals and pathogens; (3) Fabrication and characterization of responsive materials for optical sensors; (4) Energy storage devices for distributed sensors; (5) Hospital ICU-in-a-Bag whose aim is to develop a low-cost portable test-bed for physiological control systems; (6) Wireless Sensor-Brain-Computer-Interface (SBCI) that will allow monitoring and reconstruct somatosensory functions; (7) Bio-sensors for mirco robots that will involve methods for interfacing synthetic biological systems with non-living components, thereby creating microbiorobotic sensors; (8) A non-tactile body contact sensor for legged robots; (9) Real-time planning for robots using RGB-D sensors what will involve real-time motion planning to allow humanoid robots to interact safely in complex environments; (10) Ultralow energy computations for at-sensor processing; (11) Software-based redundancy in sensor networks.<br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/>The project will engage a group of ten undergraduate students, who have little or no opportunities for STEM oriented research, with a meaningful research project in the area of sensor technologies. Under the careful mentorship of a faculty member, students will contribute to academically based discovery that may lead to better sensors and systems for medical, robotics, communications, environmental, energy and surveillance applications. This experience will serve as a strong motivator for the students, who do not traditionally do not go to graduate school, to consider going a graduate career in science and engineering. This will significantly increase the pool of a highly educated workforce in areas of strategic importance to the country. The program will also form an intellectual hub for other student involvement such as high school students from intercity high schools. The SUNFEST program will act as a catalyst for a broader involvement and supportive environment for underrepresented students."

There are many approaches to robot control, such as teleoperation, handcoding, and planning, speech and gesture instruction, each with strengths and shortcomings. Learning from demonstration (LfD) is a compelling alternative in which robots are programmed implicitly from a user's demonstration rather than explicitly through an intermediate form (e.g., hardcoded program) or task-unrelated secondary skills (e.g., computer programming). Current methods either focus on learning tasks with single fixed objectives directly from demonstration data or multivalued tasks where assumed skill-level controllers provide 'symbol grounding' in the form of subtask-level capabilities. <br/><br/>This project focuses on bridging the gap between LfD for single-objective skills and symbol-grounded tasks, and on developing practical algorithms for improved multivalued robot LfD (e.g., through infinite mixture regression). The project is providing more flexible and easier mechanisms for teaching robots new tasks, thus the project is establishing structured pathways for broad populations of society, from secondary schools to research groups, to engage in autonomous robotics.

The robot, to be donated to International Rescue System Institute at Tohoku University in Sendai, will be based on the recent improvements that would make CRAWLER more resistant to water and more cleanable and maintainable. The system expands on the present robotic systems developed by the team to enable the use of multi-camera, orthogonal vision system for emergency responders that would be attached to the robot for enhanced situational awareness. This new vision subsystem constitutes part of its novelty. The Japanese-USA academic researcher team will be engaged in some of the following activities:<br/>- Develop methods to analyze the efficacy of the improved robot?s vision system.<br/>- Engineer and deploy the robot to collect data about the degree of contamination. <br/>- Deploy the robots in Japan through Japanese colleagues at the International Rescue System Institute at Tohoku University in Sendai.<br/>The investigators collaborate with Dr. Satoshi Tadokoro (Tohoku University), a search and rescue researcher.

The project is expected to fabricate an improved version of the robots (developed under a separate NSF grant) in extreme environment tests, and donate this robot to the Japanese lab for joint experimentation and in-situ testing. Additional funding is also requested to travel to Japan for collaborative research and experimentation. Proposed are also interactions and coordinating efforts with Robin Murphy (TAMU) who is organizing a workshop following up on the disaster in Japan (the related travel funds are not part of this proposal).<br/>Broader Impacts: <br/>This proposal promises an immediate benefit to society by supporting economic recovery efforts in Japan through a participatory research paradigm. Moreover, long term benefits for future disasters are in evidence since emergency response and unmanned systems are both formative domains and the data collected will advance the discovery and understanding of intelligent, human-centered systems in unpredictable situations. In addition, the use of the proposed tool should establish an important milestone in robotics allowing the nuclear power industry to be better positioned to rapidly respond to disasters in the future. Finally, the project aims to train undergraduate and graduate students and expose them to high-impact application areas. The PIs have strong track record in advising underrepresented students."

Of the non-fatal injuries and illness cases reported in the U.S. workforce, 43% of injuries were due to bodily reaction/exertion, and 62% of illness cases were due to repetitive trauma. This innovative solution will facilitate the automation of repetitive, injury-prone manual tasks and greatly improve the speed, accuracy, and cost-efficiency of current robotic handling systems. Beyond handling, there is significant market potential in packaging and warehousing, hazardous materials handling, medical device and other precision manufacturing, and military applications such as bomb defusal and evacuation robots.

Object grasping and manipulation by robotic hands in unstructured environments demands a sensor that is durable, compliant, and responsive to various force and slip conditions. The goal is to be the first commercially available sensing package that integrates tactile and visual data with accompanying software for state estimation.

The multi-robot CPS is designed to function in the same way as an adult assisting a child in learning to walk (addressing the research target area of a science of CPS by introducing developmental rehabilitation robotics). It addresses the research target area of new CPS technology by introducing a multi-robot system: 1) a multi-cable scaffold robot that continuously modulates the stabilization of medio-lateral and anterior-posterior sway, and 2) a soft, wearable, exosuit robot with embedded sensing and actuation, which assists with stance push off and swing flexion. The objective is to build a prototype multi-robot CPS and perform tests with human subjects to evaluate the CPS functionality, safety, and interoperability (addressing the research target area of engineering CPS). Longitudinal tests of typically developing and developmentally delayed children learning to walk with or without assistance of the multi-robot CPS are conducted in a motion capture laboratory. Body center of mass behavior as well as gait parameters of walking are measured as the two robots work together to assist the child in maintaining balance and propelling the body forward with each step.<br/><br/>This exosuit/scaffolding multi-robot technology will advance knowledge within engineering with bio-inspired soft components, including miniature pneumatic artificial muscle actuators with embedded sensors that enable the control of the muscles in real time. The bio-inspired architecture and material components of the exosuit will make possible a new generation of ?smart fabric? that acts in concert with the body for efficient energy use. The exosuit is part of a larger modular design that makes it possible to couple it to additional assistive robots via a modular communications network. Together, the exosuit, scaffold robot, and wireless communications network for modular CPS, will advance knowledge for the engineering of other CPS that require high levels of interoperability and safety, such as medical CPS. <br/><br/>The multi-robot CPS is designed for children who are developmentally delayed as a result of early brain injury. The long term consequences of early brain injury, e.g., in children born prematurely, constitute a major health problem and a significant emotional and financial burden for families and society. The use of a multi-robot cyberphysical system as part of a rehabilitation program may be able to harness the potential of the nervous system for plasticity, the ability to re-organize its structure, function, and connections. The focus is on young children with a history of early brain injury due to prematurity. However, this new cyberphysical system will have a much broader impact in restoring function throughout the life span. Neuroplasticity is not just an immediate response to injury, but occurs throughout the developmental period, providing an opportunity to promote repair and re-education, and restore function. A key to this broad application is the developmentally-motivated, modular structure and interoperability of the exosuit."

The subsequent report concluded that America is in danger of losing its leading position in robotics. Arguably, the U.S. remains the world leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning research. Such research is critical to advancing the cognition that robots need to interact with people and manipulate objects in unstructured environments. This need for machine cognition thus provides American roboticists with opportunities to fill critical gaps and both vertically advance and lead the field. The annual IJCAI event (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence) is a venue that can bring American and International roboticists and AI experts together. For over a decade-and-a-half, the IJCAI has held the Robotics Workshop and Exhibition as part of the overall conference. Such a venue provides a unique opportunity for the community to formulate roadmaps that leverage and apply America?s strengths in artificial intelligence to robotics. Towards this, the 2009 IJCAI Robotics Exhibition and Workshop (Pasadena CA July 13-17, 2009) will emphasize the use of robotics outside of academia by creating a joint forum with the commercial and amateur sectors.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: The workshop ?Beyond Academia: Exploring the Lessons and Best Practices in Commercial and Amateur Robotics? focuses on sharing the needs and expectations of robotics from all communities. Speakers from Willow Garage, iRobot and the amateur robotics publication Make Magazine will offer unique perspectives and approaches to common challenges from the perspective of repeatability, measurement and situated deployment. The cross-pollination of these ideas and experiences is crucial to the successful integration of AI into robotics. The ultimate goal of the workshop is to generate a white paper describing joint research opportunities. This has intellectual merit because both the AI and robotics communities are at a crossroads regarding how to best move robotics forward toward algorithms and experimental approaches that produce repeatable results in unstructured environments. The exhibition consists of four themes that relate to subsequent robotics challenges: 1) multirobot teaming, 2) learning by demonstration, 3) manipulation, and 4) undergraduate robotics challenges. Each of these areas has been identified as focus areas for the integration of AI and robotics by previous NSF supported workshops.<br/>Broader Impact: Complementing the workshop discussions and panel will be a significant number of hands-on exhibits. Here, research teams will showcase working demonstrations that support the challenge themes of learning, teaming and manipulation. Exhibits will be on display for 2 full days during the general IJCAI Conference, providing an excellent opportunity to engage a broad technical audience. The exhibits will also be open to the general public to raise awareness of the state-of-the-art. Students from local schools and summer camps will be invited to visit. In previous years, the exhibition attracted local school groups that attended via a day field trip. Access to the exhibits provides an opportunity for students and leaders to learn how robotics and AI play important roles in society."

Robots are a fantastic platform for students to learn key CS concepts, begin to program and get immediate feedback, and to learn about both hardware and software, and the interplay between the two. Robotics has a widespread base of appeal to students, academics and the general public alike. A Social Robot is one that interacts and communicates with humans by following the social rules attached to its role. The role and its rules are defined through society. For example, a robotic waiter would have to comply with established rules of good service. It should be anticipating, reliable and most of all discreet. A social robot must be aware of these rules and comply with them. There are many aspects to the evolution of Social Robots, which need to draw on elements of Design, Psychology, Cognitive Science, Communication and Philosophy in addition to, and in harmony with, traditional Computer Science and Engineering principles. The multi-school team plans to use this proposal to build a community of stakeholders in Social Robotics in the Capital Region of upstate New York. On top of planned regular meetings, and the gathering and collection of information, they will hold four open workshops at a local public Museum, to bring together the stakeholders with academics, students, and representatives from industry and members of the public, to outline a program in Social Robotics. The central aim of the program is to design alternative mechanisms of entry into, and routes through, a Social Robotics curriculum designed to enable students with a wide variety of skills and interests to interact. Both Pull mechanisms, drawing students into a Computer Science program and Push mechanisms, to deliver key concepts in other majors are planned. This plan leverages the collaboration of schools and colleges in the Capital region, as no one school is ideally placed to deliver such an education. The outcome of this proposal will be a plan of implementing a program in Social robotics, which can be implemented both locally, and nationally."

For human beings, natural language is an additional means of acquiring knowledge. This work will investigate how a robot can use language to acquire useful knowledge, and subsequently will test the results of the investigation by simulating a robot that can ask questions of a user. The robot uses a coordinate system defined by its own body - a self-centered coordinate system. For example, it might use a polar coordinate system in which the robot is always at the origin. To grasp an object, the robot must know the coordinates of that object. Natural language has words like ""left"", ""right"", and ""behind"" to describe self- centered coordinates. Gestures are also used- such as pointing ad a door and saying ""Go through that door"". Thus a user can give a robot the information it needs in order to find objects. This work will develop a tool that will ultimately be useful to robots. It will also investigate how the meaning of an utterance depends on the physical environment in which it occurs."

This study will result in both fundamental scientific knowledge and a practical application revolving around the development of highly maneuverable unmanned aerial vehicles based on flapping-wing robots. The intelligence of birds manifests itself in the evasive talents of flocks of birds and this proposal attempts to recreate that intelligence through the challenge of applying a bird-like robot to the problem of preventing aircraft/bird collisions near airports. According to surveys by the International Bird Strike Committee, none of the existing systems to prevent bird strikes on airfields are adequate. The reasons include habituation by birds to these systems; movement of birds to other parts of the area, or scattering of them all over the airfield; and the tendency of birds to come back when a threat has gone. The only proven lasting way of removing birds is by using live birds of prey, but real birds are too difficult to control and train. An alternative is to study and extract the behaviors and dynamics of real birds in order to develop and deploy a robotic lookalike. The objective of this proposal, motivated by the problem of keeping airfields clear of disruptive avian flocks, is to develop control and sensing strategies for bird-like flapping robots that can be deployed in swarms to fend off ""antagonists."" This work will build upon the PI's previous work on the control of flapping-wing aircraft using limit-cycle-based central pattern generators (CPGs), and on the dynamics and control of flexible, articulated-wing aircraft.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: Society as a whole stands to benefit immensely from robotic birds that can effectively prevent bird strikes, which cause airplane crashes and millions of dollars annually in damage. Furthermore, because of their high aerodynamic efficiency in forward flight, articulated-winged flapping aerial robots equipped with sensors could have tremendous value by being able to inspect hazardous areas. For the field of robotics, the proposed transformative research will make far-reaching contributions, advancing the state of the art in aerial robotics, cooperative control theory, and control of flexible robot structures. Additionally, this project's education and outreach activities will help introduce a new generation of young people, including those from underrepresented populations, to the excitement of science and engineering careers. Multiple avenues of educational outreach will be pursued, taking advantage of the powerful appeal of the topics of robotics and bio-inspired flight."

A Bayesian model segments task demonstrations into simpler components and recognizes instances of repeated skills across demonstrations. Established methods from control engineering and reinforcement learning are leveraged and extended to allow for skill improvement from practice, in addition to learning from demonstration. The project aims to unify existing research on each of these ideas into a principled, integrated approach that addresses all of these problems jointly, with the goal of creating a deployment-ready, open-source system that transforms the way experts and novices alike interact with robots.<br/><br/>A simple interface that allows end-users to intuitively program robots is a key step to getting robots out of the laboratory and into human-cooperative settings in the home and workplace. Although it is often possible for an expert to program a robot to perform complex tasks, this programming is often very time-consuming and requires a great deal of knowledge. In response to this, much recent research is focusing on robot learning-from-demonstration, where non-expert users can teach a robot how to perform a task by example. Unfortunately, much of this work is limited to the artificially-structured demonstration of a single task with a well-defined beginning and end. By contrast, human-cooperative robots will be required to efficiently and incrementally learn many different, but often related, tasks from complex, unstructured demonstrations that are easy for non-experts to produce."

Many high performance alloys exhibit property amplifications similar to those observed in nature and physiology, and the science of relating this property amplification to a material's hierarchical structure is gaining in maturity. However, careful control of the interfaces and interphases between constituents continues to pose theoretical and applied challenges across disciplines, ranging from challenges attaching composite wings to civil aircraft to challenges in understanding and regenerating attachments between tendon and bone in rotator cuff reattachment surgery. It will bring together experts across the life sciences, the physical sciences, and materials engineering to discuss the state of the art in our understanding of this grand challenge across disciplines, to identify additional major challenges and solutions that exist across disciplines, with the goal of providing future direction to this field. The intellectual merit of this symposium lies in addressing the critical need to bring together this cross-disciplinary expertise to unify and identify future directions for this field at an important stage of the field's development.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/><br/>The broader impacts of this symposium lie in the development of young and future scientists, and the symposium's aim of inspiring and motivating further inquiry into the study of interfaces.

First, the conference makes it possible for the exchange of ideas among members of the geometry community in the Midwest, as well as dissemination of important recent advances, nationwide and worldwide, in differential geometry, geometric analysis, integral geometry, and related fields in the broad sense. This helps cement research collaborations, brother-sister-hood, and mathematical contact. Second, the conference is committed to create a focused environment, conducive to a lively exchange of ideas, in which members of this regional community can benefit from each other's ideas, and from contact with leading geometers from outside the region. The intent of the conference is to be a top-drawer, cutting-edge research conference, attempting (as much as resources permit) to bring in the appropriate speakers at all levels, independent of where they are based. The conference will reflect, complement, or interact the main areas of focus of geometers in the Midwest. Funds will be used to for the travel and hosting costs for speakers, and participants. Minorities, women, persons with disabilities, graduate students, and junior faculty are especially encouraged to participate and to apply for support. Prior to the conference, experienced conference participants will present one or more introductory warm-up talks for interested graduate and undergraduate students. Public talks will address audiences for the public at large.

PETRA is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments. What connects different disciplines in this highly interdisciplinary but topical conference is the ability to discover new alliances, share data and design new methods that have real-world social impact while also advancing each field scientifically. PETRA projects assume a human is at the center of ""cyberphysical systems"" where the digital world merges with the physical. PETRA 2012 will address timely computational challenges including integration mechanisms of diverse sensor technologies, modeling heterogeneous data, synthesis and analysis of data streams, privacy and security of information, ranking, cleaning, storing and retrieving sensor data streams for pattern analysis and discovery, robust remote rehabilitation mechanisms, correlating brain imaging with behavioral imaging, handling intensive real time data in complex environments, and ways to interpret seemingly meaningless data in order to derive meaningful human behavioral patterns and/or to identify important ""events"" or changes. PETRA 2012 will also incorporate new exciting aspects in improving the quality of human life and health, such as how clinical and biomedical indicators are connected with observed behavioral patterns over time to refine a particular treatment. <br/><br/>The goals of the Doctoral Consortium are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers. Student participants in the Doctoral Consortium will be drawn from diverse communities including computer science, engineering, psychology, social science, neuroscience, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and communication. They will make formal presentations of their work and will receive feedback from a faculty panel; the feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented. The workshop faculty members will bring a wide spectrum of expertise, and provide student mentoring and coordination. Doctoral Consortium attendees will be asked to create and maintain ""conference workbook"" (webpage) where along with their work they include feedback on papers they attended and observations that they gathered (e.g., through meetings and discussions with conference speakers and other participants) that will apply to and impact their work. Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the Conference Proceedings (which are included in the ACM Digital Library), and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website. <br/><br/>Broader Impacts: The PETRA 2012 Doctoral Consortium will bring together some of the best students, researchers and practitioners in relevant fields, and will thereby afford the younger participants a unique opportunity to gain wider exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact. The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities. To further assure participant diversity, the organizers will endeavor not to accept more than 2 students from any one institution."

The Summer School, initiated in 1931 and currently offered every five years, is the premier teaching training workshop for new chemical engineering faculty.<br/>The Summer School is unique in its emphasis on the development of new chemical engineering educators. There is no other educational forum which is comparable in scope - targeted specifically toward training new chemical engineering faculty. And no other engineering discipline has a comparable forum offered on a consistent basis. By targeting faculty at the beginning of their careers, professors can become more effective educators ? more capable of producing better qualified undergraduate and graduate chemical engineering professionals. In the Summer School, new faculty learn how to integrate the latest developments in the field effectively and seamlessly into the chemical engineering curriculum. The Summer School also aids in the career development of new faculty by providing them extensive resources and network opportunities.<br/>Historically, around 200 new chemical engineering educators attend the Summer School each time it is offered. Thus, the Summer School has enormous broad impact, as new faculty become much more effective at educating the next generation of chemical engineers. And, the Summer School has a proven track record of effectiveness with testimonials from previous attendees confirming its value. The teaching abilities of new chemical engineering faculty are improved significantly, and the breath and timeliness of new topics incorporated by these faculty into courses taught at their home institutions is enhanced. Student evaluations of the teaching capabilities of new faculty who attend the Summer School increase significantly.<br/>The 2012 Summer School will both capitalize on the many successful aspects of the previous Summer Schools and include several novel aspects. Innovations include the addition of international faculty participation (both faculty presenters and early-career faculty), collaboration between industry and academic representatives in the workshop presentations, and the industrial Q & A panel session. The 2012 Summer School will also emphasize the linkage between research/teaching and engagement with external constituent groups, including industry, K-12, and other stakeholders. This linkage will be emphasized via an NSF session, a day-long Teaching Institute, and through workshops in career development, K-12 engineering education, and combining research and educational scholarship. Finally, an additional assessment instrument will be introduced which gathers input from faculty participants approximately one year after their attendance at the Summer School. This instrument will both help confirm the longer- term impact the Summer School has on participants and provide useful feedback for improving the School even more in the future."

The event will take place on Monday, March 5, 2012, immediately preceding the Seventh Annual Human Robot Interaction Conference (HRI 2012) to be held March 6-8, 2012, in Boston, and which is jointly sponsored by ACM and IEEE. The theme of HRI 2012 is ""Robots in the Loop,' which highlights the importance of autonomously capable robots in enhancing the experiences of human users in everyday life and work activities; the conference will emphasize embodied robotic systems that operate, collaborate with, learn from, and meet the needs of human users in real-world environments. More information about the conference is available at http://hri2012.org/.<br/><br/>The Young Pioneers Workshop is designed to complement the conference, by providing a forum for students and recent graduates in the field of HRI to share their current research with their peers and a panel of senior researchers in a setting that is less formal and more interactive than the main conference. During the workshop, participants will talk about the important upcoming research themes in the field, encouraging the formation of collaborative relationships across disciplines and geographic boundaries. To these ends, the workshop will include sessions in a variety of formats. Attendees will hear short talks from 3 selected student participants; those students not invited to give an oral presentation will participate in an interactive poster session. A panel of five senior researchers will share their expertise and insights on how to address the interdisciplinary challenge of HRI. The afternoon breakout session will involve small groups of 3-5 attendees with diverse backgrounds working to design an integrative HRI project, encouraging group participation and the cultivation of cross-disciplinary ideas. The presentation session afterward will allow 10-15 minutes for each breakout group to present a summary to the entire workshop; the organizers anticipate that the discussions will continue during dinner.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts: This workshop will afford a unique opportunity for the best of the next generation of researchers in human-robot interaction to be exposed to and discuss current and relevant topics as they are being studied in several different research communities (including but not limited to computer science and engineering, psychology, robotics, human factors and ergonomics, and human-computer interaction). This is important for the field, because it has been recognized that transformative advances in research in this fledgling area can only come through the melding of cross-disciplinary knowledge and multinational perspectives. Participants will be encouraged to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development, to form collaborative relationships, and to generate new research questions to be addressed during the coming years. Participants will also gain leadership and service experience, as the workshop is largely student organized and student led. The PI will act aggressively to recruit young researchers from minority and underrepresented groups in order to assure diversity of the participants across a variety of dimensions, so that the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field. The PI will conduct pre- and post-workshop surveys in order to validate the effectiveness of the 2012 Young Pioneers Workshop."

High-end tools for data basing and graphing exist, but usually entail a large overhead in time and effort associated with: importing the data; correctly specifying meta-data; keeping track of a large number of variable names; issuing and scripting commands for graphing; plotting pairwise variables over many iterations; filtering out bad data; re-rendering plots to restricted data ranges; representing multiple variables at once; and so on. This team has developed Filtergraph, a web based tool that allows rapid and intuitive visualization of massive, multi-dimensional datasets. 

The web-based tools developed by this team will allow researchers to instantly visualize any dataset in many dimensions at once, and will permit researchers to move through the data rapidly, and quickly filter and slice them. This visual interaction will occur without the need for cumbersome meta-data specification, without the need to remember details of the data structure, and without the need to write scripts to render sophisticated visualizations. The tools developed will be a means to an end: A new, highly visual way of transcending preconceptions about the data and instead let the data speak for themselves. This mechanism would free researchers to creatively and collaboratively engage their expert intuition as they visually and rapidly explore massive datasets for unexpected patterns or outliers that signal important discovery."

These challenges include computation, interaction, visualization and user challenges. Addressing the computation challenge is a central research focus and remains a prominent direction in the field, while the other challenges are often overlooked. The goal of this CAREER project is to address these less investigated challenges by pioneering a comprehensive framework toward effective visual understanding of flow fields. It contributes to the state of the art flow visualization by promoting an innovative database approach to shape-based field line modeling and classification, investigating new string-, sketch- and graph-based interfaces and interactions for flow field exploration, and exploring occlusion and clutter reduction through unconventional streamline repositioning and automatic tour generation. The general approach developed in this research is expected to substantially improve our ability to visually understand a wide spectrum of flow fields, ranging from the traditional application of fluid flows to new applications such as traffic flows, cash flows and message flows. This project will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students in the area of data visualization and scientific computing via capstone class projects. A pedagogical toolbox will be designed along with web-based resources to support teaching visualization classes through expressive demos, potentially benefiting universities nationwide with a similar teaching need. The PI will continue to attract underrepresented students through university and department outreach programs and engage local middle and high school students through summer youth programs. 

This research tackles the fundamental challenges in visualizing large, complex three-dimensional steady and unsteady flow fields. Underlying the proposed work is a novel database approach to field line shape encoding, classification and interrogation. The PI will integrate and unify a variety of concepts from geometric modeling, computer vision and data mining to create robust visual characters and words from field lines for shape analysis and organization. Novel interfaces and interactions will be introduced to enable intuitive retrieval of partial field lines via textual and visual forms, and examination of hierarchical field lines and their spatiotemporal relationships in the transformed graph space. Innovative streamline repositioning for focus+context viewing and automatic tour for examining hidden or occluded flow features will be devised to move from clutter to clarity in the visualization. The success of this research will benefit a wide variety of applications within and beyond graphics and visualization, such as shape analysis, visual perception, database organization, game development, and visualization in education.

The PI will collaborate with scientists and researchers at university, industry and national labs, applying the proposed solutions to solve real-world problems. Research results will be evaluated through both domain expert reviews and formal user studies. Selected research outcomes will be integrated into user-engaging educational applications that will be run on tablet devices and delivered to the general public for wide dissemination. This CAREER project will build a solid foundation for addressing key challenges in flow visualization, and lead to multidisciplinary collaborations spanning atmospheric cloud, combustion chemistry and cardiovascular research. It will also produce fruitful deliverables, featuring the first-ever benchmark field line shape database, tutorials and workshops at premier visualization conferences, and pedagogical tools and game apps.

Unfortunately, creating good news visualizations is a difficult and labor-intensive task that involves numerous complex decisions. A designer must identify data relevant to the article, clean the data, generate the visualization (a complex process on its own), and provide annotations to connect the article and visualization. While some design guidelines have been developed, many decisions are based on designer intuition, a process that is not scalable to the thousands of news articles that are published every day. This project seeks to build intelligent tools to help designers more quickly create good news visualizations and to develop systems that generate news visualizations autonomously. This research project will enhance citizen understanding of complex information in the news and improve numerical, graphical, and geography literacy. Additionally, the research will provide support for new job categories (e.g., data scientists, computational journalists, data analysts, etc.) and existing companies (e.g., online media, search engines, etc.) in their evolution to new interactive platforms. The research results will be integrated into a broad set of widely accessible educational materials for a variety of courses (visualization, spatial computing, and text analysis) and will serve as research and practical training for undergraduates, graduates, and professionals. 

Providing a scalable solution to automatically generating contextually-relevant visualizations requires the understanding and encoding of the design process. Specifically, the goals of this project are (a) identifying the decision process of visualization designers, (b) creating automated components that operationalize these decisions including text processing, searching through a wide range of heterogeneous data sources and datasets (e.g. census data, stock market data, government macroeconomic data), and automatic visualization construction and annotation, and (c) ranking of the visualizations based on well-known quantitative metrics from information retrieval and information visualization such as relevance, expressiveness, and effectiveness. By extracting key comparisons from an article's text through the use of natural language processing and using existing visualization-article pairs as an evaluation corpus, the system will ensure that relevant datasets are found and that the selected visual forms preserve and enhance the information conveyed in the article. For example, the system will automatically create thematic maps for geospatial comparisons of population change in the U.S. and time series for longitudinal comparisons of company financial results. Although the focus of this work in on the news domain, the research can be extended to other application areas including textbooks, internal company reports, and more generally, to any texts that implicitly or explicitly correspond to quantitative data. Further information, including source code, demos, papers, and datasets, are available at the project homepage (http://txt2vis.cond.org)."

Visualization, or the use of interactive graphics to support data analysis and understanding, has become an integral part and critical component of many application areas. IEEE VIS is the premier forum for visualization advances in science and engineering for academia, government, and industry, now bringing together about 900 researchers and practitioners from around the world with a shared interest in techniques, tools, and technology. VIS consists this year of the 24th annual IEEE Scientific Visualization Conference (SciVis), the 19th annual IEEE Information Visualization Conference (InfoVis), and the 8th annual IEEE Visual Analytics Science and Technology Symposium (VAST). Co-located symposia this year include the IEEE Symposium on Large-Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV), the IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis), and the International Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VisSec). The papers published in the special conference issue of IEEE Transactions of Visualization and Computer Graphics are rigorously refereed and widely cited. More information is available online at http://www.ieeevis.org. 

The Doctoral Colloquium at IEEE VIS is a research-focused meeting which has taken place annually at the visualization conferences since 2006, and has helped launch the careers of a number of outstanding young researchers. In 2013 the workshop will convene on Saturday, October 12, with follow-up events during the VIS technical program. A primary goal of the Doctoral Colloquium is to allow students to discuss their research directions in a supportive atmosphere with a panel of distinguished leaders and with their peers, who will provide helpful feedback and fresh perspectives. To this end each student will be assigned a specific mentor among the expert panelists and will be allotted approximately 30-40 minutes of time during the group sessions, to include a formal presentation about the student's doctoral research followed by in-depth discussions and feedback. The workshop will support community building by connecting beginning and advanced researchers (during events such as a common lunch for all DC participants, students and panelists alike, and a roundtable discussion at the end of the day where the focus will be on high-level topics beyond technical research), one of the objectives being to build a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues across the world. Student research will be disseminated via posters during the VIS technical program, and via publication in the VIS Extended Abstracts. Feedback about the Doctoral Colloquium will be provided to future conference committees. 

Broader Impacts: The VIS Doctoral Colloquium brings together the best of the next generation of visualization researchers and allows them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers, which plays a major role in their enculturation into the profession. Since the students and faculty are a diverse group on several dimensions (nationality, scientific discipline, research specialization), the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development. The PI has affirmed that in managing this event the organizers, while striving to identify and include the broadest possible group of highly qualified participants, will also make an effort to encourage participation by women, racial/ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities. They will furthermore ensure that NSF funds are used chiefly to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States."

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create significant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC?s Stampede system, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a significant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This confluence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this work. 

To address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi?cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. 

This work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualization capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that efficiently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs. In addition, the project team will disseminate this work to the general public through NSF XD program, the VisIt visualization toolkit and by exhibiting at forums such as IEEE Visualization, IEEE High Performance Graphics and ACM Supercomputing.

The standard technique for rendering geometry is rasterization and the most commonly used library for performing this is OpenGL. Many visualization programs (VisIt, Ensight, VAPOR, ParaView, VTK) use OpenGL for rendering. However, recent architectural changes on supercomputers create significant opportunities for alternate rendering techniques. The computational power available on emerging many-core architectures, such as the Intel Xeon Phi processors on TACC?s Stampede system, enable ray-tracing, a higher quality technique. Further, as the amount of geometry per node rises, ray-tracing becomes increasingly cost effective, since its computational costs are proportional to the screen size, not the geometry size. Finally, the software implementation for OpenGL can not be easily mapped to non-GPU multi-core and many-core systems, creating a significant gap; if not closed, visualization will not be possible directly on large supercomputers. This confluence of new, more capable architectures, the increase in geometry per node, and concerns about the durability of the established rendering path all motivate this work. 

To address these trends, this research uses a two-pronged approach. First, the research will replace the OpenGL pathways that are commonly used for visualization with a high-performance, open-source ray tracing engine that can interactively render on both a CPU and on accelerator architectures. This new library will support the OpenGL API and will be usable immediately by any OpenGL-based visualization package without additional code modi?cation. Second, this research will provide a direct interface to a high-performance distributed ray tracing engine so that applications can take advantage of ray tracing capabilities not easily exposed through the standard OpenGL interface, such as participating media and global illumination simulation. These features will enable the open science community to easily create photo-realistic imagery with natural lighting cues to aid in analysis and discovery. It will further expand the capacity of existing cyberinfrastructure to provide interactive visualization on standard HPC resources. 

This work has the potential to revolutionize in situ visualization capabilities by unifying the (potentially hybrid) architecture that efficiently run both simulation and visualization. Communicating with underrepresented groups will be a major component of outreach efforts through the PCARP, MITE and Women in Engineering programs. In addition, the project team will disseminate this work to the general public through NSF XD program, the VisIt visualization toolkit and by exhibiting at forums such as IEEE Visualization, IEEE High Performance Graphics and ACM Supercomputing.

The purpose of the summer school is to provide effective training for collaborative research in ecology and epidemiology using mathematical modeling and qualitative analysis. Our goal is to educate students of mathematics and statistics to address issues of great importance in ecology and epidemiology, and to educate biologists as to why and how mathematical and statistical techniques and tools are useful. Students in the mathematical and biological sciences will learn how to communicate with one another, preparing them not only to build models in ecology and epidemiology, but also to be ambassadors capable of teaching others how to cross the boundaries between biology and mathematics.

At USTARS, student researchers convene in a structured meeting, along with professional mathematicians. Students deliver 30-minute research talks in structured parallel sessions. Graduate students give 75% or more of these presentations. Two distinguished graduate students and one invited faculty member are chosen to give 1-hour presentations. A poster session features invited undergraduate researchers. Topics of presentations given in prior years include: combinatorics, braid groups, graph theory, knot theory, representation theory number theory and algebraic geometry.

USTARS is an annual symposium designed to bring together student researchers in algebra and topology, focusing on and showcasing research by underrepresented students and providing mentorship for the participants through critical educational and career transitions. In 2010, 29% of the mathematics doctorates were awarded to women, while less than 4% were awarded to minority students. USTARS promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. USTARS exposes all participants to the research and activities of underrepresented mathematicians, encouraging a more inclusive and collaborative mathematics community. Graduate students who attend USTARS are better equipped to seek academic positions and continue the cycle of mathematical research and collaboration. Undergraduate students are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, often more comprehensive than the topics available at their home institutions. A one-day workshop at the start of USTARS focuses on specific stages in professional careers and the critical transitions associated with each stage. Participants have the opportunity to network with underrepresented professors and students who may become future collaborators, colleagues, and/or mentors. USTARS participants continue to influence the next generation of students in positive ways by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.
